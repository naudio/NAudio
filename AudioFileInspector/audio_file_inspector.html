        Audio File Inspector</h2>
    <p>
        Audio File Inspector is a simple utility that describes the contents of various
        types of audio file (for example WAV files or MIDI sequences). It started out as
        a developer tool to aid in writing code that reads these various formats, but has
        been released because some people may find it useful for diagnosing problems playing
        back various media files.</p>
    <p>
        Audio File Formats are notoriously vague and it is likely that you will have some
        files on your computer that cause Audio File Inspector to generate an error message.
        If you encounter a problem, then feel free to zip the file up and email it to me
        and I will consider updating the utility to support your file.</p>
    <h2>
        Supported File Types</h2>
    <p>
        The current version of Audio File Inspector supports the following file types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>MID</b> - This will enumerate each event in the MIDI file. At the moment it
        reports the time of the event in terms of "absolute time". A future update will turn
        this into measures, beats and ticks (M:B:T)</li>
        <li><b>SF2</b> - This examines a SoundFont file, reporting all the instruments, zones
        and audio files contained within</li>
        <li><b>WAV</b> - This will report the format of the audio data, as well as providing
        binary dumps of any extra chunks of information.</li>
        <li><b>MAP</b> - This can extract some information from a Cakewalk drum map file. 
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        Download</h2>

    <h2>
        Installation</h2>
        
        <p>Audio File Inspector requires the .NET framework version 3.5 to be installed.
        You can download this <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx">
            here</a>. Once you have done this you can run the installer which will add a right-click "Describe"
            action to Windows Explorer for each of the supported file types.</p>        
    <h2>
        Usage</h2>
    <p>
        There are a variety of ways in which you can load a file into Audio File Inspector for 
        analysis.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Right-click a supported file in Windows explorer and click <b>"Describe"</b></li>
        <li>Use the <b>File|Open</b> menu option to select a file to analyse</li>
        <li>Drag a file from Windows explorer onto the title-bar of Audio File Inspector</li>
        <li>You can also drag a file over the executable itself or run Audio File Inspector
            from the command line with a filename as an argument.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
        Tools Menu</h2>
    <p>
        On the tools menu you can find commands that allow you to clear the log or to save its
        contents to disk (you are of course free to edit the contents in any way you like before
        saving it).
        
        There is also an options form, which in this version simply allows you to recreate or remove
        the right-click "Describe" option in Windows Explorer.</p>
